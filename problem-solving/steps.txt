Algorithm - A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task.

How do you improve?
1. Devise a plan for solving problems.
2. Master common solving patterns.

Problem solving steps:
1. Understand the problem
2. Explore concrete examples
3. Break it down
4. Solve/simplify
5. Look back and refactor

1. Understand the problem
    * Can you restate the problem in your own words?
    * What are the inputs that go into the problem?         - data type, how big of a number, 
    * What are the outputs that should be returned from the solution?
    * Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? Do I have enough info to solve the problem?
    * How should I label the important pieces of data?
2. Explore concrete examples
    * Start with simple examples
    * Progress to more complex examples     - lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, special characters, spaces, etc...
    * Explore examples with empty inputs
    * Explore examples with invalid inputs
3. Break it down
    * Explicitly write out each step you need to take
    * Use comments or pseudo-code to lay out each step
4. Solve/simplify
    * If you can't solve, simplify and solve a smaller problem
        * Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
        * Temporarily ignore that difficulty
        * Write a simplified solution
        * Then incorporate that difficulty back in
5. Look back and refactor
    * Can you check the result?
    * Can you derive the result differently?
    * Can you understand it at a glance?
    * Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
    * Can you improve the performance of your solution?
    * Can you think of other ways to refactor?
    * How have other people solved this problem?
